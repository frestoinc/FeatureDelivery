# Feature Delivery

A sample application POC to test the feasibility
of [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
+ [Play Feature Delivery](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/feature-delivery).
This app shows 2 ways for feature delivery; via Activity
or [Compose NavGraph](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation)

## Activity

```
context.startActivity(Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW).apply {
  data = Uri.parse("app://${appRoute.packageName}")
  `package` = context.packageName
  })
```

## NavGraph

```
navController.graph.addDestination(
    ComposeNavigator.Destination(
        provider[ComposeNavigator::class],
        (Class.forName(route.navigationRoute).kotlin.createInstance() as FeatureNavGraph)
            .moduleScreenComposable(
                modifier = modifier,
                navController = appState.navController
            )
       ).apply {
        this.route = route.route
        }
    )
```
